# Crop Yield Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between agricultural factors and crop yields using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The project uses five datasets from Kaggle:
- yield.csv
- pesticides.csv
- rainfall.csv
- temp.csv
- yield_df.csv

## Analysis Performed
1. Data preprocessing and integration
2. Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
3. Feature engineering
4. Machine learning model development and evaluation
5. Feature importance analysis
6. Model validation

## Key Findings
- Decision Tree model achieved R² of 0.980
- Pesticide usage showed strongest correlation with yields (0.42)
- Optimal temperature range: 20-25°C
- Optimal rainfall range: 1,000-1,500 mm/year

## Files
- `crop_yield_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
- `*.png`: Visualization files generated during analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
